App using MKGeodesicPolyline to draw path between two locations, then displaying the distance in Kilometers.


Why MKGeodesicPolylines? What's MKGeodesicPolyline? 

MKGeodesicPolyline is used to render a direct straight path on a curved surface, such as Earth's. Here the "direct" path
appears as an arc because of the curvature of the Earth. I chose MKGeodesicPolylines because it is more realistic than using a plain line between the points.
